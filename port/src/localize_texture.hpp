// Pictures of text. Some of the game's words are not messages but textures (an area's name card, the floor
// labels, a boss's name), one picture per language. The localization takes these from
// `textures/<language>/<name>.png` in the language folders (the save folder's before the executable's; the
// language is the same file stem as the language's JSON, `en_gb`, `fr_fr`...), so they follow game.language
// like the messages do. `<name>_<w>x<h>.png` is tried first, for a name two textures of different sizes share.
// A picture is scaled to the size of the texture it replaces; one whose shape differs from the texture's is
// left unused. tools/textpack writes these from the language's own words, without a shadow: the port casts it,
// from `<name>_text.png` (what is lettering) if the language has one, else from the picture's own opacity, at the
// strength of the Options slider for that kind of text (area names, floor labels, bosses' names).
