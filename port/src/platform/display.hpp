// Keeps video.width, video.height and video.fullscreen true to the window. SDL may refuse a change
// of mode or finish it late, so the window is read back: after a DisplayApply that changes the
// window, or a pump that reads it back, the fields are the mode it is in (the fullscreen window's
// kept size and the --width and --height overrides aside). A window resized by hand changes no
// setting; runtime display edits go through DisplayApply. A warning stands until a later change of
// mode takes; while it does, or a fullscreen change SDL took is unfinished, the pump follows the
// window.
